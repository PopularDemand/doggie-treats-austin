In the README, include a link to the deployed version.
In the README, include a "Guided Tour" path the reviewer should follow when reviewing the app in the browser. This tour should highlight the best (and most challenging) parts of your app. This should detail exactly the steps that the reviewer should take in order to review your app. They will certainly poke around in other ways but this will save them from having to think about what to review first.
In the README, include explicit instructions for how to use the app, if different from the Guided Tour or more complex.
In the README, include a "Technical Highlights" section which discusses briefly how the application is constructed (remember that they will receive submissions from people with all sorts of backgrounds) and some bullet points with the key technical parts you think will highlight your skills well (e.g. an algorithm you used or a way you made it faster or a trick of the architecture). Don't be shy about highlighting the things you did to make this awesome -- remember that reviewers will otherwise probably miss these things.
In the README, include explicit instructions for how to download and run the repo on their machine. Test these instructions yourself.
